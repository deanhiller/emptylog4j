emptylog4j
======

contains some empty classes so that a platform using log4j and calling into configuration classes can still compile and run and users can then
swap in logback easily enough as well

run ./build.sh build to build it

We are using gradle so run ./build.sh eclipse or ./build.sh idea to generate project files
